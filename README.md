# CatSphere — Swarm Robotic System for Cats

## Project Summary

This website documents **CatSphere**, a speculative design and technical prototype exploring a **modular swarm-robotic system for cats**. The project investigates how multiple soft robotic agents—each with a specific function (playing, scenting, feeding, and cleaning)—can collaboratively create a responsive indoor environment that supports feline well-being.

The website is structured as a **design-to-technology narrative**, combining research, system architecture, interaction simulation, and visual storytelling. Rather than presenting a single product, the project demonstrates a **system-level approach** that integrates behavior, form, and technical logic.

## Website Structure

The website consists of three main sections:

### Research  
Covers background research, market analysis, literature review, and early concept exploration. This section frames the design problem and justifies why a swarm-based, multi-functional system is worth exploring.

### Prototype  
Presents the system architecture, technical diagrams, functional breakdowns of each robot module, and physical design development. This section explains how sensing, communication, actuation, and form are conceptually integrated.

### Simulation  
A browser-based interactive simulation that visually demonstrates how different robot modules behave and interact with a cat in a shared space. This simulation is not a physics-accurate model, but a **behavioral and experiential prototype** used to communicate system logic.

## Technologies & Frameworks Used

- **HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JavaScript**  
  The entire website is built using standard web technologies without external front-end frameworks. This ensures portability, transparency, and ease of review.

- **Canvas API (HTML5)**  
  The simulation page uses the `<canvas>` element to render animated scenes, including robot movement, scent diffusion, feeding behavior, and cleaning progress.

- **Custom Styling (CSS)**  
  Layouts, gradients, animations, and typography are custom-written to support a soft, playful visual language consistent with the project’s theme.

No backend services or databases are used; the site is fully client-side.

## Purpose of the Simulation & Use of AI Tools

The simulation serves as a **conceptual and experiential prototype** rather than a fully engineered robotic system. Its primary purpose is to visually communicate how different functional robot modules—playing, scenting, feeding, and cleaning—might coexist, coordinate, and interact with a cat within a shared indoor environment. By using simplified motion, timing, and visual cues, the simulation helps viewers intuitively understand system behavior, role switching, and overall interaction flow without requiring physical hardware.

AI tools were used **selectively and intentionally** at different stages of the project:

- **Early Brainstorming & Ideation**  
  During the initial concept phase, AI tools such as *Armin Geni* were used to support brainstorming by generating a wide range of speculative directions and alternative ideas. These tools helped explore multiple interaction metaphors, robot roles, and system configurations before narrowing down to the final swarm-based approach. All ideas were curated, evaluated, and refined through human design judgment.

- **Simulation Development (Partial AI-Assisted Vibe Coding)**  
  In the simulation file, AI-assisted “vibe coding” was used at an early stage to scaffold basic canvas animation logic, scene transitions, and timing structures. The resulting code was then **manually modified, rewritten, and extended** to match the intended behaviors of each robot module and to align with the system logic described in the Prototype section.

Overall, AI functioned as a **supportive design and prototyping tool**, not as an automated solution. All final decisions regarding system behavior, interaction design, visual language, and narrative structure were made by the designers.
