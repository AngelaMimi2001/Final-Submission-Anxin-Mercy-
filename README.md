Project Summary

This website documents CatSphere, a speculative design and technical prototype exploring a modular swarm-robotic system for cats. The project investigates how multiple soft robotic agents—each with a specific function (playing, scenting, feeding, and cleaning)—can collaboratively create a responsive indoor environment that supports feline well-being.

The website is structured as a design-to-technology narrative, combining research, system architecture, interaction simulation, and visual storytelling. Rather than presenting a single product, the project demonstrates a system-level approach that integrates behavior, form, and technical logic.

Website Structure

The website consists of three main sections:

Research
Covers background research, market analysis, literature review, and early concept exploration. This section frames the design problem and justifies why a swarm-based, multi-functional system is worth exploring.

Prototype
Presents the system architecture, technical diagrams, functional breakdowns of each robot module, and physical design development. This section explains how sensing, communication, actuation, and form are conceptually integrated.

Simulation
A browser-based interactive simulation that visually demonstrates how different robot modules behave and interact with a cat in a shared space. This simulation is not a physics-accurate model, but a behavioral and experiential prototype used to communicate system logic.

Technologies & Frameworks Used

HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JavaScript
The entire website is built using standard web technologies without external front-end frameworks. This ensures portability, transparency, and ease of review.

Canvas API (HTML5)
The simulation page uses the <canvas> element to render animated scenes, including robot movement, scent diffusion, feeding behavior, and cleaning progress.

Custom Styling (CSS)
Layouts, gradients, animations, and typography are custom-written to support a soft, playful visual language consistent with the project’s theme.

No backend services or databases are used; the site is fully client-side.
